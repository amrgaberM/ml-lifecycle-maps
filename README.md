# Machine Learning Lifecycle — Visual Mind Maps

This repository provides a curated collection of **high-quality mind maps** covering the essential stages of the **Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle**. Each visual is designed to offer a clear, structured understanding of key concepts and workflows — ideal for both practical implementation and interview preparation.

---

## Overview

These mind maps serve as a comprehensive reference guide for:

- **Practitioners** implementing ML pipelines in real-world projects
- **Learners** developing conceptual clarity and retention
- **Candidates** preparing for technical interviews or certifications
- **Teams** creating documentation or onboarding resources

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01-data-collection/` | Key methods and strategies for acquiring, accessing, and integrating structured and unstructured data |
| `02-data-cleaning/` | Common data quality issues and solutions including missing data, duplicates, type conversions, and anomaly detection |
| `03-eda/` | Core exploratory data analysis techniques for understanding distributions, relationships, and trends |
| `04-feature-engineering/` | Transformations, encodings, interaction features, domain-specific feature creation, and best practices |
| `05-model-evaluation/` | Evaluation metrics, model validation techniques, error analysis, and performance tradeoffs |

Each folder contains a mind map that distills the most important concepts and techniques used in that stage of the ML lifecycle.

---

## Objectives

- Provide a **visual-first learning resource** for core ML topics
- Enable efficient revision and concept recall
- Encourage better design and planning of ML workflows
- Support knowledge sharing and professional documentation

---

## Future Enhancements

Planned additions include:

- Interactive dashboards or notebooks linked to each mind map
- Companion text summaries or cheat sheets for each topic
- Domain-specific extensions (e.g., NLP, time series, computer vision)
- Advanced topics such as MLOps, model monitoring, and deployment strategies

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. If you would like to add new mind maps, propose edits, or suggest improvements, please feel free to open a pull request or issue. All contributions should maintain the same quality standards and visual consistency as existing materials.
